                                            As of Sept 19, projections are now made comparing week-over-week and day-by-day case growth, using only data from the two most recent weeks.
                                            For example, to create Monday's projection, we take the Fri-Mon case growth from a week before, and the Fri-Mon case growth from two weeks before.
                                            We see if the growth rate has increased or decreased, and by how much.
                                            Projections assume that growth rate trend will continue.

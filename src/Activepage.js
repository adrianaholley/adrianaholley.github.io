                                    Each time Tech posts an update, they share the number of cases moved into "recovery" on that date. 
                                    For example, Sept 14 they shared there were 154 new recoveries. 
                                    Since the majority of COVID illnesses are considered "recovered" 12 days from first symptoms or test date, we assume these cases began on Sept 2.

                                    Updates given on Mondays (or any update after a gap, really), are cumulative from the weekend, and Sept 14 was a Monday. 
                                    That means some of those cases may have recovered on Sept 12 or Sept 13, which means they actually started Aug 31 or Sept 1.

                                    We (you and I) only know the number of illnesses that started during this time by counting 12 days backward once they've recovered. 
                                    Since the cases that started in the past 12 days have not recovered yet, we don't know how many cases started during that time.
